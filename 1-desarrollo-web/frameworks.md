## JQuery, Vue.js, ReactJS & EmberJS


### What is jQuery?

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.


### What about Vue.js?

Vue.js  is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.

It features an incrementally adoptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages

Vue was created by Evan You after working for Google using AngularJS in a number of projects. He later summed up his thought process: "I figured, what if I could just extract the part that I really liked about Angular and build something really lightweight." The first source code commit to the project was dated July 2013, and Vue was first released the following February, in 2014.


### React

"A JavaScript library for building user interfaces". It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications, as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded. However, fetching data is only the beginning of what happens on a web page, which is why complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, who released an early prototype of React called "FaxJS".

### Ember.js

"A framework for ambitious web developers."

Ember.js is an open-source JavaScript web framework, based on the Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) pattern. It allows developers to create scalable single-page web applications by incorporating common idioms and best practices into the framework.

Ember is used on many popular websites, including Discourse, Groupon, LinkedIn, Vine, Live Nation, Nordstrom, Twitch.tv, and Chipotle. Although primarily considered a framework for the web, it is also possible to build desktop and mobile applications in Ember. The most notable example of an Ember desktop application is Apple Music, a feature of the iTunes desktop application.The Ember trademark is owned by Tilde Inc.
